# Expense Keeper Web App

Welcome to the Expense Keeper web app! Originally developed during the McHacks11 hackathon, our team aimed to create a user-friendly tool for efficient expense management. While I initially led the front-end development during the hackathon, we encountered challenges that hindered project completion. Subsequently, I revisited the project to rewrite and enhance the backend, resulting in the improved backend code available in the `backend2` file.

## Features (Work in Progress)

- **Expense Tracking:** Record and categorize your expenses to facilitate better financial management.
- **Customization:** Personalize categories and preferences to suit individual needs.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Bootstrap)

### Backend
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the development of this evolving Expense Keeper web app! Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
