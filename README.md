Expense Keeper Web App
Welcome to the Expense Keeper web app! Originally developed during the McHacks11 hackathon, our team set out to create a user-friendly tool to help manage expenses. I initially led the front-end development during the hackathon. Despite facing challenges that prevented us from completing the project, I revisited it later to rewrite and gain a better understanding of the backend. The updated backend code, available in the backend2 file, reflects this effort.

Features (Work in Progress)
User Authentication: Secure user accounts and logins to ensure data privacy.
Expense Tracking: Record and categorize your expenses for better financial management.
Data Visualization: Visual representation of expense trends to aid in financial analysis.
Customization: Personalize categories and preferences to suit individual needs.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap)
Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
